# three tier architecture with cdk

This repo contains code for a three tier application consisting of web layer, app layer and data layer.
The template is highly customizable with many features thanks to the CDK's flexibility, including custom IP's for the VPC and the optional provisioning of the database layer. 

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
